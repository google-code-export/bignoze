# Introduction #
An issue is anything that could have an effect on the website (either detrimental or beneficial).

Issues will fall into one of the following categories:

### Defects ###
Bugs, errors or omissions found in work already conducted or currently underway.

### Changes ###
Changes to the requirements, however minor, which will cause a change to the web functionality.

Changes can be further classified as:

### Functional Changes ###
Requires a change in the way the website functions.  Functional changes can only be applied by the developer.
### Display Changes ###
Any change that requires changes to the look, feel or display of any screen or email – but does not change the system’s functionality.  Screen changes can only be applied by the developer.
### Content Change ###
Any web content change that can be achieved through using the existing system content management tools (e.g. merchant data changes or static content pages).  These changes can be applied by the website administrators.

If a request for a change is rejected as out-of-scope for the pilot it may be reclassified as a **Future Requirement**

### Actions ###
Actions are tasks associated with managing and operating the website which are not a defect or change (e.g. send a communication to producers).

### Queries ###
Questions about any aspect of the website, for instance an assumption that needs validating or a point of information needing clarification.
