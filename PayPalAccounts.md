# Producer PayPal Account Type #

Producers need to have either a **Premier** or a **Business** account type with PayPal in order for buyers to be able to use their credit cards for payment rather than using a PayPal account.  Personal accounts do not work.

With release 11.7 (see [Issue 646](https://code.google.com/p/bignoze/issues/detail?id=646)), we have now implemented a check on the Edit Producer page to check the account type as well as the account name (must match with the contact name on the page).

Producers registered prior to this check going in have mainly been identified manually and the accounts corrected, but there may be some that still need to upgrade their account types.  A recent example of this (29/8/13) was Ausnat Fruits which was using a personal account.  This means that they may have lost potential orders as only those with PayPal accounts would have been able to purchase from this producer.

With upgrading account types, if the producer is currently using a trust account, then it will present problems with them trying to upgrade to a Business account type. Therefore, in these cases, it would be better for them to upgrade to Premier.
